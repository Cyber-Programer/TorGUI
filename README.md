## What is Tor?


The full form of Tor is "The Onion Router." Tor provides a secure and anonymous connection. The highlighted part of Tor is that it provides a network that helps you stay anonymous and secure when you use the internet. It works by bouncing your internet traffic through different computers around the world. Just remember, while Tor is helpful, it's still important to be careful and not share personal information online.
